# PHP-MySQL-Xampp
News Portal Development with Access Control using PHP, MySQL / phpMyAdmin database, and Xampp.
Design and implementation of a dynamic web application for news management. I developed a secure authentication system from scratch and a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) architecture. The system differentiates between visitors, registered users, and administrators, granting specific read and edit permissions according to privilege level, thus ensuring data integrity and security.
I created this website using PHP in Visual Studio Code.
The database was created using phpMyAdmin.
I used Xampp to simulate the local server communicating the webpage and the database.
